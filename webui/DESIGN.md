## Overview

Hermes WebUI should feel like a calm developer console, not a demo page assembled from colorful cards. The primary artifact is the conversation. Tool calls, thinking traces, context compaction records, token usage, and runtime status are useful, but they are transcript metadata and should sit below the visual priority of user and assistant prose.

The desired direction is Linear/Vercel precision with a little Claude-style conversational warmth: quiet surfaces, clear spacing, restrained accent use, and progressive disclosure for debugging detail.

## Colors

- **Primary (#EAE0D5):** main text on dark surfaces. The warm parchment should feel readable and grounded, not like bright white terminal text.
- **Secondary/Tertiary (#C6AC8F):** metadata and restrained accent. Use sparingly for active state, focus, user bubbles, and quiet emphasis.
- **Neutral (#0A0908):** app background and ink. This gives the WebUI depth without returning to the previous navy/gold theme.
- **Surface (#22333B):** panels, sidebar, and stronger interactive surfaces. It should carry the structure while the conversation remains primary.
- **Light surfaces (#EAE0D5 / #F4EEE7):** light mode uses the palette's parchment as the field and a slightly lifted derived surface for panels.
- **Semantic colors:** success/warning/error/info are state colors only, not decorative palette choices.

## Typography

Use Claude-like split typography: assistant prose gets an editorial serif stack (Georgia as the available substitute for Anthropic Serif), while user bubbles and functional UI stay in a crisp sans stack. This keeps the bot voice calmer and more readable without making controls feel bookish. Use monospace only for code, file paths, commands, tool names, and compact metadata. Avoid making whole cards feel like terminal output unless they actually are logs.

Scale should stay tight: 11px metadata, 12px labels, 14px body, 16–18px headings. Do not proliferate 10px/10.5px/12.5px one-offs unless there is a real layout constraint.

## Layout

Conversation rhythm:

1. User message — right aligned, compact bubble.
2. Assistant content — left aligned, prose-first, no heavy bubble.
3. Tool/thinking/context traces — quiet disclosure rows inside the assistant turn.
4. Raw logs/details — hidden until explicitly expanded.

Metadata should not break the reading flow. A turn that used ten tools should read as one assistant turn with one compact `Used 10 tools` disclosure, not ten content cards.

## Elevation & Depth

Use almost no shadows in the transcript. Shadows are reserved for popovers, dropdowns, modal dialogs, and floating controls. Cards inside chat should use either a subtle border or a subtle tint, not both aggressively.

## Shapes

- Rows/list items: `4–8px` radius.
- Cards/panels: `8–12px` radius.
- Pills: only true chips/badges use `999px`.
- Avoid stacks of nested rounded rectangles. If a card contains another card, one of them is probably unnecessary.

## Components

### Tool/thinking activity group

Collapsed by default in settled history and during live runs. Summary line uses one disclosure for internals, e.g. `Activity: thinking + 4 tools · read_file, patch, terminal`. Expanding reveals thinking and individual tool cards together. Thinking and tools should not create separate transcript rows unless there is an error or approval state that needs attention.

### Tool card

A tool card is a debug event row, not a chat message. Show icon, name, short target/preview, and status. Arguments and result snippets stay behind expansion. Result snippets should be truncated; full logs belong behind “show more”.

### Thinking/context cards

Same visual family as tool-call metadata. They should be quieter than assistant prose and should not use bright tinted full cards unless the user expands them.

### Composer

The composer is the command surface. Keep it legible and focused: modest radius, subtle border, transparent inactive chips, no theatrical hover scaling.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do:

- Collapse noisy agent internals by default.
- Use one accent color at a time.
- Prefer neutral borders and restrained surfaces.
- Make debug traces accessible and inspectable without making them visually dominant.
- Add stable class/data hooks for future visual regression tests.

Don't:

- Render every tool call as a first-class chat card.
- Mix gold, cyan, purple, orange, red, and green as decorative colors in the same viewport.
- Add new hardcoded radius/color values when a token exists.
- Use shadows, gradients, and hover transforms for routine controls.
- Hide important error or approval states; those are allowed to be prominent because they require action.
