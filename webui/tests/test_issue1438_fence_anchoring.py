"""Regression tests for #1438 — triple backticks mid-line should not terminate fences.

Bug shape (issue #1438): the fence regex `/```([\\s\\S]*?)```/g` had no line
anchoring. A literal triple backtick inside a code-block content (e.g. a regex
pattern with ``` in a lookbehind) terminated the outer fence at the wrong place.
The leaked tail then went through bold/italic/inline-code passes, eating `*`
characters and leaking literal `</strong>` tags into the rendered output.

Reported by Cygnus (Discord, May 1 2026), relayed by @AvidFuturist.

Fix: anchor the fence regex per CommonMark §4.5 — opening fence must start a
line (with up to 3 spaces of indent), closing fence must also start a line.

Sites patched:
  static/ui.js:1557  — renderMd() fenced-block stash
  static/ui.js:74    — _renderUserFencedBlocks() (user message renderer)
  static/ui.js:2597  — _stripForTTS() (TTS pre-strip)
  tests/test_sprint16.py — Python mirror (two regexes to keep in sync)

Note on the Python mirror: it does not implement `_ob_stash` (which protects
`<code>` from outer bold/italic) or `_pre_stash` (which protects `<pre>` from
paragraph-wrap). So mirror output may show extra `<em>` inside `<pre>` blocks
or `<pre>` wrapped in `<p>`. These are mirror-only artifacts; the actual JS
pipeline produces clean output. Tests below focus on the structural property
that the fence regex captures the correct extent — the part that's identical
in both implementations.
