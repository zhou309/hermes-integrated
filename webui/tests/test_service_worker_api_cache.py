"""Regression tests for service worker API cache exclusion under subpath mounts.

The WebUI can be served at /hermes/. In that deployment API requests look like
/hermes/api/sessions, not /api/sessions. The service worker must treat those as
network-only; otherwise cache-first handling can serve a stale sidebar session
list until the browser cache/service-worker cache is cleared.
