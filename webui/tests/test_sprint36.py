"""
Sprint 36 Tests: cancelStream cleanup no longer depends on SSE event (PR #309 / issue #299).

The old cancelStream() set "Cancelling..." status and then relied on the SSE cancel
event to clear it. If the SSE connection was already closed, the event never arrived
and "Cancelling..." lingered indefinitely.

The fix: cancelStream() now clears status, busy state, and activeStreamId directly after
the cancel API request completes — regardless of whether the SSE cancel event fires.
The SSE handler still runs if it arrives (all operations idempotent).

Covers:
  1. cancelStream() clears activeStreamId unconditionally after the fetch
  2. cancelStream() calls setBusy(false) unconditionally
  3. cancelStream() calls setStatus('') / setComposerStatus('') unconditionally
  4. cancelStream() clears composer status text unconditionally
  5. The catch block no longer calls setStatus(cancel_failed) — cleanup runs even on error
  6. The SSE cancel handler is still present (idempotent path)
  7. cancel_failed i18n key is still defined in all locales (key exists, just not used in
     the catch-path anymore — kept for potential future use)
