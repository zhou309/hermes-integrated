"""Regression tests for two related sidebar/panel UI fixes.

1. Workspace panel header collapse priority — as the right panel narrows,
   the git-badge must vanish first, the "Workspace" label second, and the
   icon buttons last. Previously all three compressed simultaneously
   because `.panel-header` used `justify-content:space-between` with no
   flex-shrink ratios or container queries.

2. Project color dot truncation — the dot used to be appended INSIDE the
   `.session-title` span (which is `overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis`),
   so the dot got clipped along with long titles. Fix moves the dot to a
   flex sibling in `.session-title-row` between title and timestamp, and
   moves `.session-time` from `position:absolute` to flex flow so the
   title's `flex:1` bound stops at the timestamp's left edge.
