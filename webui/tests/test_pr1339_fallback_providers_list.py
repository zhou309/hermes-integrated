"""Test for PR #1339 — streaming.py must support both single-dict `fallback_model`
and list-form `fallback_providers` config without crashing on `.get()`.

Before the fix, when config had `fallback_providers: [{provider, model, ...}, ...]`,
streaming.py read it as if it were a dict and called `.get('model', '')` on a list,
which would raise `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'`.

The fix makes streaming.py handle both legacy dict form and new list form, picking
the first entry from the list when given a list.
