"""Tests for incremental streaming-markdown (smd) integration in messages.js.

PR: feat: use streaming-markdown for incremental live rendering

The change replaces the per-rAF `assistantBody.innerHTML = renderMd(...)` call
with an incremental DOM-building approach powered by the streaming-markdown
library (https://github.com/nicholasgasior/streaming-markdown):

  - During streaming: smd.parser_write() feeds new text deltas into a live DOM
    tree — no full re-render per frame, no innerHTML thrash.
  - On done/apperror/cancel: smd.parser_end() flushes remaining parser state,
    then Prism / copy buttons / KaTeX are run on the live segment.
  - On tool event: smd.parser_end() finalises the current segment; the next
    token after the tool creates a fresh parser bound to the new assistantBody.
  - Fallback: when window.smd is not yet loaded, the old renderMd path is used.
  - Reconnect: _smdReconnect flag clears stale DOM from the previous parser run
    and restarts the smd parser from the reconnect point.

Tests are static (regex / AST-level) — no browser required.
