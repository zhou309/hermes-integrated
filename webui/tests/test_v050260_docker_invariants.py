"""Regression tests for v0.50.260 — Docker compose file invariants.

PR #1428 fixed a UID/GID mismatch between the agent container and the webui
container in the two- and three-container compose files. This test module
pins the invariants that prevented the original bug from coming back AND
extends coverage to the related fixes shipped alongside #1428:

- All compose files reference the same UID/GID source (`${UID}` / `${GID}`)
- All compose files document the bind-mount permission escape hatches
  (`HERMES_SKIP_CHMOD`, `HERMES_HOME_MODE`) inline so users hit by #1389
  or #1399 see the fix in the file they're reading
- The `.env.docker.example` template ships and documents the same vars
- `docs/docker.md` exists and covers the multi-container architecture
- Stale README references to `/root/.hermes` are gone (the agent images
  use `/home/hermes/.hermes`)
