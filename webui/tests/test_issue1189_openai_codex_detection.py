"""
Regression test for #1189 — openai-codex provider group should appear
in the model picker when OPENAI_API_KEY is configured.

The env-var detection block in ``api/config.py`` previously mapped
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` to only the ``openai`` provider group; the
``openai-codex`` group has its own static model list in
``_PROVIDER_MODELS`` (9 models: gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4, codex-specific
variants, etc.) but no automatic detection path.

Note (cross-tool): hermes-agent's ``openai-codex`` provider config
declares ``auth_type="oauth_external"`` with a default
``inference_base_url=https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`` — the same
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` does NOT actually authenticate the default Codex
endpoint.  Users without an OAuth state will see codex models in the
picker but hit auth errors at use time.  The fix is still net-positive
UX (no manual config.yaml edit needed for users who DO have both), but
the simple detect-on-OPENAI_API_KEY shortcut is documented here as a
known limitation.
