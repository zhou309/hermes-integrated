"""Regression tests for v0.50.258 Opus pre-release follow-up.

PR #1419 introduced server-side `?next=` redirect after session expiry. The
initial implementation built the outer `next` parameter via:

    _next = quote(path, safe='/:@!$&\'()*+,;=')
    if query:
        _next += '?' + query
    location = '/login?next=' + quote(_next, safe='/:@!$&\'()*+,;=?')

Two problems with this shape:

1. The inner `?` was kept literal because both `quote()` calls had `?` in
   their `safe` set. Combined with `&` also being kept literal, paths with
   multi-param queries (`/api/sessions?limit=50&offset=0`) round-tripped as
   `/api/sessions?limit=50` — the rest got eaten as a top-level outer query
   parameter the login page ignored.

2. Attacker-controlled paths with embedded `&next=...` could inject a second
   top-level `next` parameter. Browsers' URLSearchParams.get() returns the
   first-match (safe), Python's parse_qs returns last-match (unsafe). The
   downstream `_safeNextPath()` rejects non-`/` prefixes which closed the
   actual exploit, but the parser-divergence is a footgun.

Fix: percent-encode the entire `path?query` blob with `safe='/'`, so `?`,
`&`, `=` all get encoded. The outer `next` then holds exactly one
path-with-query string that the browser auto-decodes once.
