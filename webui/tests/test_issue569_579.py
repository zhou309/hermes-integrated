Tests for fixes:

- #569: docker_init.bash auto-detects WANTED_UID/WANTED_GID from mounted workspace
         so macOS users (UID 501) don't need to manually set the env var.
- #579: Topbar message count already filters tool messages (role !== 'tool').
         The legacy raw sidebar count was removed by #584, and later reintroduced
         in a gated detailed-density mode by #673.
