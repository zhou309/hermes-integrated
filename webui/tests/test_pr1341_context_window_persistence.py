"""Regression test for PR #1341 + Opus pre-release review of v0.50.246.

PR #1341 added context_length/threshold_tokens/last_prompt_tokens fields to
the Session model — but didn't add the writer that actually populates them
during streaming. The pre-release review caught this: without the writer,
the user-visible bug (context-ring shows 0% after page reload) would NOT
have been fixed by #1341 alone.

This test verifies that:
1. After a streaming turn completes, the session's context_length /
   threshold_tokens / last_prompt_tokens are written from the agent's
   compressor BEFORE s.save() is called (so they land on disk).
2. GET /api/session response includes the populated values.
3. A reloaded session retains the populated values.

Implementation reference: api/streaming.py around line 2188 (the per-turn
post-merge save) writes from getattr(agent, 'context_compressor', None).
